I'm Netanel, a third-year student pursuing a B.Sc. in Digital Sciences for High-Tech and Economics at Tel Aviv University. 
Throughout my studies, Iâ€™ve developed strong proficiency in Python, with a focus on data analysis and machine learning using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. 
I also have experience programming in C and have gained a solid understanding of operating system fundamentals, core computer science algorithms, and data structures.
Moreover, my service in the Israeli Navy as a ship mechanic instilled in me a strong sense of teamwork, effective cross-functional collaboration, and the ability to perform under pressure in high-stakes environments.
**Looking for my first job as a Junior Software Engineer!**
